Kallifield-Weave: Tools for Sentient Field and Resource Modeling
Welcome to the Kallifield-Weave repository! This project contains two complementary programs inspired by the conceptual framework of The Sentient Republic: Weaving Justice in the Field of Reality. These tools simulate the Sentient Field Hypothesis (SFH) and Resource-Based Economy (RBE) principles, offering interactive visualizations and simulations to explore qualic coherence and equitable resource distribution.
Overview

SFH_Simulation.py: A Python script using Pyodide-compatible Pygame to simulate qualic coherence dynamics, modeling the Sentient Field's optimization process (e.g., MCMC-based ( J(q) = \alpha C(q) + \beta F(q) )).
RBE_Resource_Model.js: A JavaScript file leveraging p5.js to create a web-based visualization of RBE resource allocation, demonstrating equitable distribution across a grid.

These programs are designed for educational and experimental use, reflecting the philosophical and technological ideals of Kallifield—a hypothetical city aligned with justice, abundance, and field-tuned harmony.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

For SFH_Simulation.py:
Pyodide environment (e.g., JupyterLite or a browser-based Python runtime).
Basic understanding of Pygame (adapted for web compatibility).


For RBE_Resource_Model.js:
A modern web browser.
p5.js library (hosted via CDN, e.g., https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.2/p5.min.js).



Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Kallifield-Weave.git
cd Kallifield-Weave


Ensure the files are in the /src/ directory as provided.

Usage
SFH_Simulation.py

Purpose: Simulates a 10x10 qualic grid, updating coherence levels with a random walk model inspired by MCMC optimization.
How to Run:
Load in a Pyodide environment (e.g., JupyterLite).
Execute the script to visualize qualic dynamics (note: Pygame visualization is placeholder-adapted for browser use).


Example:
Open in JupyterLite, run cell-by-cell, and observe the grid’s evolution.



RBE_Resource_Model.js

Purpose: Visualizes a 10x10 resource grid, simulating equitable distribution over time using p5.js.
How to Run:
Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) with:<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.2/p5.min.js"></script>
    <script src="RBE_Resource_Model.js"></script>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>


Open index.html in a browser to see the resource grid animate.


Example:
Watch green rectangles adjust, reflecting balanced resource levels.
