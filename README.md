# Kallifield-Weave: Tools for Sentient Field and Resource Modeling

Welcome to the **Kallifield-Weave** repository! This project contains two complementary programs inspired by the conceptual framework of *The Sentient Republic: Weaving Justice in the Field of Reality*. These tools simulate the Sentient Field Hypothesis (SFH) and Resource-Based Economy (RBE) principles, offering interactive visualizations and simulations to explore qualic coherence and equitable resource distribution.

## Overview

- **SFH_Simulation.py**: A Python script using Pyodide-compatible Pygame to simulate qualic coherence dynamics, modeling the Sentient Field's optimization process (e.g., MCMC-based \( J(q) = \alpha C(q) + \beta F(q) \)).
- **RBE_Resource_Model.js**: A JavaScript file leveraging p5.js to create a web-based visualization of RBE resource allocation, demonstrating equitable distribution across a grid.

These programs are designed for educational and experimental use, reflecting the philosophical and technological ideals of Kallifield—a hypothetical city aligned with justice, abundance, and field-tuned harmony.

## Getting Started
### Usage

#### SFH_Simulation.py
- **Purpose**: Simulates a 10x10 qualic grid, updating coherence levels with a random walk model inspired by MCMC optimization.
- **How to Run**:
  - after downloading the repository run the simulation.html file in a brower and it will run.

#### RBE_Resource_Model.js
- **Purpose**: Visualizes a 10x10 resource grid, simulating equitable distribution over time using p5.js.
- **How to Run**:
  - after downloading the repository run the RBE_Resource_Model.html file in a browser, it will run.
  - Watch green rectangles adjust, reflecting balanced resource levels.
